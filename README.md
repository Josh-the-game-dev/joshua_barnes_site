The repository holds a page for a WIP(Work in progress) personal website. The assets folder has the placeholds for the profile and resume sections these will be changed at a later date to hold my actual resume and profile picture. The Styles.css code folder has the background and foreground colors, text font, text size, positioning, border color and thinkness, and a few other general programs. The Script.js is the script that that controls what does/causes what to happen. there is a piece of code that controls the dark mode toggle on the upper right side of the page. it even changes the symbol to match which background is currently being used. lastly, the index.html is where the actual text is stored. it is similar to what is in the styles.css, but is how one would write plain text in a document using html. I have used the format a few times myself, so I can actaully read and edit it myself with confidence that I won't break something.
